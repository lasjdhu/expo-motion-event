## üíª Basic Usage

You can see the working example in the `example` directory.

```tsx
export default function App() {
  const [event, setEvent] = useState<MotionEvent | null>(null);
  const [fps, setFps] = useState(60);

  useEffect(() => {
    startListening();
    setTargetFPS(fps);

    const subscription = addMotionEventListener((motionEvent) => {
      setEvent(motionEvent);
    });

    return () => {
      subscription.remove();
      stopListening();
    };
  }, [fps]);

  return (
    <SafeAreaView>
      <View>
        <Pressable onPress={() => startListening()}>
          <Text>Start</Text>
        </Pressable>
        <Pressable onPress={() => stopListening()}>
          <Text>Stop</Text>
        </Pressable>
        <TextInput value={fps} onChangeText={(e) => setFps(Number(e))} />
      </View>

      <Text>{JSON.stringify(event, null, 2)}</Text>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}
```

Unlike gesture-based libraries, `motion-event` is designed for low-level event handling, making it ideal for use cases requiring precise touch tracking, such as custom multi-touch interactions and real-time input processing.
