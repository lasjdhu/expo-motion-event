**Motion Event** is an Expo module that provides seamless access to Android's native `MotionEvent` API, allowing developers to capture and interact with low-level touch and motion events in their React Native applications.

## üöß Work In Progress

**‚ö†Ô∏è This package is still under development and is not yet ready for production use. It is not installable or usable at the moment. Please do not use it in production environments.**

The module is being actively worked on, and updates will be made to the README as the project becomes stable and usable.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

```tsx
import { MotionEventView } from "motion-event";
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Text, View } from "react-native";

export default function App() {
  const [motionEvent, setMotionEvent] = useState<MotionEventPayload | null>(null);
  const [gestureEvent, setGestureEvent] = useState<GestureEventPayload | null>(null);
  const [targetFPS, setTargetFPS] = useState(30);

  const handleMotionEvent = (event: { nativeEvent: MotionEventPayload }) => {
    setMotionEvent(event.nativeEvent);
  };

  const handleGestureEvent = (event: { nativeEvent: GestureEventPayload }) => {
    setGestureEvent(event.nativeEvent);
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <MotionEventView
        targetFPS={targetFPS}
        onMotionEvent={handleMotionEvent}
        onGestureEvent={handleGestureEvent}
      />

      <Text>Motion Event:</Text>
      <Text>
        {motionEvent
          ? JSON.stringify(motionEvent, null, 2)
          : "No motion events yet"}
      </Text>

      <Text>Gesture Event:</Text>
      <Text>
        {gestureEvent
          ? JSON.stringify(gestureEvent, null, 2)
          : "No gesture events yet"}
      </Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```
